# SCorrelatorFolder [Under Construction]

A class to unfold, backfold, and/or perform corrections on an n-point energy correlation strength function. Much like the [SEnergyCorrelator](https://github.com/ruse-traveler/SEnergyCorrelator) class, this will be designed in such a way that it can run in two modes: a **"standalone"** mode in which the class can be run in a ROOT macro on already produced [input](https://github.com/ruse-traveler/SCorrelatorJetTree), and a **"complex"** mode in which the class is run as a module on the sPHENIX node tree.
